{"id": 2, "name": "Akusaa", "description": "Aegyptus Scholar and Occultist (Sage)\nA highly knowledgeable linguist and occultist originally from Aegyptus, Akusaa is a woman in her early thirties who left that area under some duress. She was accused of stealing sacred tomes, a crime she did not actually commit, and is now an outcast from her homeland. She supports herself by taking work as a translator but is more interested in seeking out lore regarding Germanic mysticism in the frontier region, which is what has brought her to the Laurium area. She is on the hunt for mystically potent relics to investigate a theory she has on the ways the gods empower and guide favored mortals.\nAkusaa is polite and well-spoken, though prone to conversing a touch too formally and made uncomfortable by some of the rugged and unfamiliar habits of those living in the frontier region. She prefers to adopt an androgynous appearance and feels uneasy when people focus on her femininity. \nShe has had some small brushes with the supernatural, particularly in her dreams, which have taken her to strange and vividly inexplicable places. She is convinced the gods are active participants in mortal affairs, not always to mortals\u2019 benefit. She finds conflict distasteful and seeks others to help her defend herself against threats that may arise in the course of her pursuits.", "truths": [{"id": 5, "description": "Aegyptus"}, {"id": 6, "description": "Dreamwalker"}, {"id": 7, "description": "Seeking the Lost"}, {"id": 8, "description": "Student of the Occult"}, {"id": 9, "description": "I Have a Secret"}], "attributes": {"id": 2, "agility": 6, "brawn": 6, "coordination": 9, "gravitas": 9, "insight": 11, "reason": 11, "will": 10}, "actualStress": 0, "maxStress": 11, "actualInjuries": 0, "maxInjuries": 3, "fatigue": 0, "armour": 0, "courage": 2, "languages": " Coptic, Aramaic, Celtic, Germanic, Greek, Latin, Punic", "caste": "Outcast", "resources": 0, "background": "Scholar", "personalAgenda": "Acquire an Object.
