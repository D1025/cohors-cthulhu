{"id": 4, "name": "Herodion", "description": "Greek Courier (Schemer)\nHerodion is a Greek man in his early thirties who has led an interesting but sometimes difficult life, having overcome a number of obstacles through his intelligence and determination. In his youth, he survived as an orphaned urchin in the streets and was later enslaved, but he was eventually able to purchase his freedom. His memories of his family are hazy, but he has held onto one of being told his ancestors once lived in Atlantis, before it fell\nAs a youth, he received enough education to prove his worth as a favored servant during his enslavement to a wealthy Roman family in Colonia. He attained a ready mastery of letters and numbers, eventually securing a position as a clerk. Since acquiring his freedom, he has more often worked as a courier and messenger. He is pragmatic and morally flexible, quite willing to take advantage of situations to ensure his survival. He is skilled with a blade and prepared to use it, though he prefers to talk his way out of trouble.\nKey to turning his fortunes around in Colonia was garnering the attention of a secret patron who spotted his potential and recruited him to join a branch of the Fingers of Dawn. He is still a junior and largely uninformed member of this cult, but he is ready to answer the call when its people reach out to him. He is also eager to acquire any information that might be of use to them, in order to improve his standing. Many of his courier jobs are connected to this group, including a recent task to bring important missives to the town of Laurium.", "truths": [{"id": 14, "description": "Greek"}, {"id": 15, "description": "Atlantean Ancestry"}, {"id": 16, "description": "Former Servant"}, {"id": 17, "description": "I Have a Secret"}], "attributes": {"id": 4, "agility": 9, "brawn": 9, "coordination": 9, "gravitas": 10, "insight": 8, "reason": 8, "will": 8}, "actualStress": 0, "maxStress": 11, "actualInjuries": 0, "maxInjuries": 3, "fatigue": 0, "armour": 1, "courage": 0, "languages": "Greek, Latin (conversational)", "caste": "Plebian", "resources": 2, "background": "Urchin", "personalAgenda": "Uncover Secrets.
