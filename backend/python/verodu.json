{"id": 5, "name": "Verodu", "description": "Gaulish Smuggler and Bandit (Scoundrel)\nNow in their late twenties, Verodu has never thought of themself as a criminal, but crime has nonetheless often been their only means of survival. Originally from one of the tribes of Gaul, Verodu has proven to be a capable smuggler, mercenary, and occasional bandit along the rivers of the Germanic frontier. They lived in Bonna for a time but recently decided to seek better fortunes in Laurium, where their unique skills might be of use. Verodu knows their way around boats and feels as comfortable on the deck of a riverboat as they are walking a forest path. They are quite willing to fight to protect what they have earned, and they aren\u2019t above fighting dirty.\nVerodu was raised as a girl but is adaptable, viewing themself as neither man nor woman. This has offered some complications in the patriarchal societies Verodu moves in, but Verodu is happy in their own skin, and feels no particular pressure to conform to any one gender. They often change their presentation based on how they wish to be perceived. For a great deal of Verodu\u2019s life as a nonviolent criminal, being seen as a woman was difficult, so Verodu became comfortable at feigning being a man, including adopting facial makeup to compensate for a lack of mustache or beard, which is otherwise seen as a mark of maturity among male Gauls.", "truths": [{"id": 18, "description": "Gaul"}, {"id": 19, "description": "Born of the Waters"}, {"id": 20, "description": "Smuggler"}, {"id": 21, "description": "I Have a Secret"}], "attributes": {"id": 5, "agility": 11, "brawn": 11, "coordination": 8, "gravitas": 7, "insight": 11, "reason": 6, "will": 7}, "actualStress": 0, "maxStress": 12, "actualInjuries": 0, "maxInjuries": 3, "fatigue": 0, "armour": 4, "courage": 1, "languages": "Celtic (Gaulish), Germanic (rudimentary), Greek (conversational), Latin (few phrases)", "caste": "Outcast", "resources": 0, "background": "Criminal", "personalAgenda": "Accumulate Wealth.
