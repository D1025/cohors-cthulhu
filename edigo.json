    "description": "Germanic Priest of Tiwaz (Mystic)\nBorn of the Bructeri tribe, Egino is a true holy man who reveres many Germanic gods but is especially devoted to Tiwaz, known to some as Tyr. Egino is an older man, in his late fifties, and has served his people for his entire life, being descended from a noted lineage famed for its memorable Mystics, including Egino\u2019s father. Egino has been recognized as an elder of his tribe and has been involved in a number of important meetings regarding its well-being. Recent years have been difficult for his people, as their villages have been afflicted with some sort of curse, which Egino has been desperate but so far unable to solve. He suspects some nefarious cult might be behind this misfortune.\nThough he might have been more physically formidable in his youth, Egino has since become a somewhat frail older man, one who is not particularly well suited for battle or strife. Nevertheless, he has true mystical power achieved through prayers to his gods and the power of runecraft. Exhibiting a noble demeanor and being both well-spoken and persuasive, Egino has been able to solve most of the challenges facing him with the help of his quick wit and silver tongue. Versed in some of the healing arts, he has spent time easing the suffering of others, earning him more friends than enemies. He has come to the Laurium region hoping to find allies and information that might prevent the doom of his people.",
